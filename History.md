5.1.2 / 2018-01-24
==================

  * Fix: cyclic dependencies is hard.


5.1.1 / 2018-01-23
==================

  * Fix: cyclic dependencies won't be an issue if one of the modules is executed already. That is, the require itself is deferred.


5.1.0 / 2018-01-16
==================

  * New: integrate babel-core to support components and node_modules transformations;
  * New: use opts.transformOnly to white list node_modules to transform, no node_modules will be transformed by default;
  * Fix: parse `require('dir')`s as alias `{ dir: 'dir/index'}` and store them in dependenciesMap;
  * Fix: dependencies in dependenciesMap should be re-visited rather than overriden;
  * Fix: both `require('foo')` and `require('foo/entry')` can happen in components and node_modules.
  * Fix: cyclic depedencies workaround.


5.0.1 / 2017-08-17
==================

  * Fix: adding screw_ie8 option for UglifyJS.Compressor()


5.0.0 / 2017-07-26
==================

Yet another major release, yay! I highly suspect that the major version number has now surpassed the number of oceanify users. Anyway, here's the breaking changes:

  * Breaking: components needs to be prefixed with package name and version, such as `<script src="/oceanify/5.0.0/index.js"></script>`. In this way components can have versioning also.
  * Breaking: `opts.importConfig` is now renamed to `opts.loaderConfig`
  * Breaking: `opts.self` is now renamed to `opts.serveSelf`
  * Breaking: `opts.base` is now renamed to `opts.paths` and becomes array to support multi-level components directory
  * Breaking: `/import.js` is now renamed to `/loader.js`
  * Breaking: dropped Node.js 4

Here's new features:

  * New: use `opts.mangleExcept` to skip UglifyJS mangling on certain modules.
  * New: use `opts.loaderConfig.system` to skip parsing therefore makes remote loaderConfig loading possible.
  * New: css `@import`s will be handled server side and processed in advance before requests.

There's too much fixes and upgrades that I'd rather not list here. Besides, there will be even more fixes and upgrades for sure.
